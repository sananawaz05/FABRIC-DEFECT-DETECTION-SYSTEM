# FABRIC-DEFECT-DETECTION-SYSTEM

Developed a real-time fabric defect detection system using
YOLOv8, Python and Streamlit to automate textile quality control. Achieved 95 percent accuracy in detecting
defects like holes and stains using a custom dataset of 720 images. Optimized for industrial deployment with fast,
accurate, and low-intervention performance.
